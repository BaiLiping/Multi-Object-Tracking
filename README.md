# Multi-Object-Tracking

This is the repository of one of the most screwd up project I have ever been part of. 
I had quite a lot of respect for the academic and specifically the professors doing control theory. However, my advisor just sold me to the most moronic human
I have ever met. Liu Jia Nan, the most fucked up self-promoting human there. There are so much more that I want to say about how screwed up the whole thing is, but in the right channel.
