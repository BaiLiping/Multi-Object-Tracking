This is the documents from previous project. The previous lab works on moving the ideas presented in top tier papers to lesser tier papers. Specifically, they try to convert what has long been known in the field of radar signal processing and point data processing into the realm of intelligent vehicle. All the codes are converted from MATLAB code of Yuxuan Xia's lab into Python. 

After consulting with legal professionals, I was informed that it is absolutely up to me to make the work available since everything is in public domain. If Liu Jianan you have any issue with this, contact me directly.
