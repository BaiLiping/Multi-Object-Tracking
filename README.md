This document contains information from a previous project. The previous lab focused on adapting ideas from top-tier papers to lesser-tier papers, specifically aiming to apply concepts from radar signal processing and point data processing to the realm of intelligent vehicles. All the code has been converted from MATLAB code used in Yuxuan Xia's lab to Python.
